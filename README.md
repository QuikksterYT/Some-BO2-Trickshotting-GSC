# Some-BO2-Trickshotting-GSC
My Take on AutoSpawnBots &amp; Sniper Only Damage (w/ almost hit &amp; distance meter) [Trickshotting GSC]

Just a simple post for people who struggle with damage setups like myself [I have very very bad ADD & ADHD as well as developing signs of Dyslexia, so reading a big jumble of code can be tough at times]

In my version, I made it so bots don't absolutely sh*t on you while trying to trickshot (which is what normally happens when they are allowed to use snipers or reg guns) - While simultaneously preventing them all from bunching up, causing it to become harder to hit shots.

Alongside this, the bots scores will be reset after every single kill they get.

This should get you set up with a decent start for a trickshotting server, Cheers!
